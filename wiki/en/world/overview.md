# Overview

After the Final War annihilated the real world, two surviving experimental subjects — the girl Sophia and the boy Noah — sought to restore human civilization through a fusion of science and magic.
Thus, within a quantum computer, they reconstructed a virtual world nearly indistinguishable from reality: Kamitsubaki City.

Sophia chose to sacrifice herself, dissolving her body into countless fragments, becoming the source that drives the world’s endless cycle. Whenever the city is destroyed, her lingering will triggers a phenomenon that allows Kamitsubaki City to be reborn.
Noah, however, gradually strayed from their shared ideals. What he longed for was not the continuation of a virtual illusion, but the chance to live with Sophia again in the real world. To achieve this, he created information-based lifeforms known as Tesseractors — entities that devour fragments of the virtual world to accumulate mass, hoping to reshape reality itself.

From that moment, Kamitsubaki City fell into an endless cycle of ruin and rebirth.
The Tesseractors became a calamity beyond the city’s control — the embodiment of humanity’s malice and desire. At their origin stands Maxwell, the progenitor of all Tesseractors and the incarnation of Noah’s obsession. His power can transform Kamitsubaki City into an Incomprehensible space, unleashing the Blackout.
He not only creates, resurrects, and commands Tesseractors, but also molded five boys to walk among humans — subtly guiding the witchlings toward despair.

Since Sophia’s fragments were limited, she created an information entity named Blue Bird, serving as the “Reconstruction Chief” of Kamitsubaki City. Blue Bird gathers external fragments and shoulders the mission of resisting the Tesseractors.
At the same time, Sophia’s remaining power became a spark, passed down to five girls — the witchlings. Through their songs, they can wield magic, purify Tesseractors, and at the height of their growth, ascend into true witches with even greater power.

Yet their destiny is unbearably tragic.
The witchlings are trapped in an endless loop; with each death, they lose all memories of their past lives, forced to continue fighting in confusion. They once hailed from the real world and, for various reasons, responded to the Reconstruction Chief’s call to enter Kamitsubaki City — unaware that what awaited them was an eternity of reincarnation.

Through countless cycles of destruction and rebirth, they slowly approached the truth.
Sometimes through shattered memory fragments, sometimes through Maxwell’s whispers, sometimes by glimpsing impossible visions within Incomprehensible space. They discovered that Kamitsubaki City is not real — it is an illusion within a quantum computer. Its citizens and everyday life are preprogrammed constructs, and their fates have long been woven into the obsessions of Sophia and Noah.

This revelation shattered their faith.
They realized that the meaning of their battles was crumbling — there was no future to protect, and their sacrifices were nothing more than endless experiments. In despair, some even fell and became Tesseractors themselves.

And yet, even in the darkest hour, someone still sang.
Even if the world was false, they could still feel genuine emotion.
Even if trapped within a predestined cycle, they still longed to sing songs that were truly their own.

Amid the intertwining of despair and hope, the witchlings struggle on — striving to prove that even if everything is illusion, their feelings are real; even if the ending is predetermined, they can still leave behind a song untouched by control.

—This is a story of obsession, recursion, and the blurred line between the virtual and the real.
A requiem for those who seek an “unconsumed hope” between destruction and rebirth.

Can the witchlings ultimately change the fate of Kamitsubaki City?
Only time will tell…
