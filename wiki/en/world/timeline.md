# Timeline

The story of **“Kamitsubaki City Under Construction.”** is divided into two major phases:

- **Cycles 0–108 (EMERGENCE)**
- **Cycles 109–115 (REGENERATE)**

For more details, see the ADV archive stories **EMERGENCE STORY beta** and **VIRTUAL WITCH STORY**.

- **EMERGENCE**: Focuses on the *witchlings* summoned from the real world, exploring the full nature of the virtual Kamitsubaki City through repeated cycles of rebirth and destruction. It serves as the “prologue” to the main storyline.  
- **REGENERATE**: The witchlings are reborn as native residents of Kamitsubaki City, with memories from birth — fundamentally different from their EMERGENCE counterparts. They can be seen as new witchlings inheriting the will of their predecessors.  

Starting from the 109th cycle, the story begins to diverge.  
Each work follows an independent development, but all are built upon the world established in EMERGENCE.

## EMERGENCE

### EMERGENCE: 0 / REGENERATE: -108
- [Morisaki Kafu](/character/morisaki_kafu) is summoned to Kamitsubaki City by the Reconstruction Chief and dies during the **Blackout**.

### EMERGENCE: 15 / REGENERATE: -93
- [Tanioki Rime](/character/tanioki_rime) is summoned to Kamitsubaki City. A week later, she meets Kafu and forms a deep bond with her.  
- On the eve of the **Blackout**, they deduce that Kamitsubaki City is a virtual world and that they will be reconstructed after each cycle, losing all memories of their previous lives. They are already close to uncovering the truth of rebirth.  

> “Even if memory fades, intent remains.”

In the following cycles, their bond deepens, like that of true sisters.

### EMERGENCE: 22 / REGENERATE: -86
- [Asanushi Haru](/character/asanushi_haru) and [Yorukawa Sekai](/character/yorukawa_sekai) are summoned.  
- Though their circumstances differ, their hearts resonate, forming a deep connection.

### EMERGENCE: 25 / REGENERATE: -83
- [Rinne Koko](/character/rinne_koko) learns of Kafu and the others from the Reconstruction Chief and volunteers to assist in Kamitsubaki City.

### EMERGENCE: 35 / REGENERATE: -73
- The five finally uncover the reason behind Kamitsubaki City’s endless destruction and rebirth, even identifying the pattern of the **Blackout**.  
- But the truth comes too late — the Blackout still descends.  
- The Reconstruction Chief tries to return them to the real world but is devoured by a **Tesseractor**, and the transfer fails.  
- The five ultimately purify **Laplace** through song.


### Cycles 36–108

- **EMERGENCE: 36 / REGENERATE: -72**  
  The witchlings discover a way to preserve memories using **Memory Eggs**.  

- **EMERGENCE: 53 / REGENERATE: -55**  
  Each witchling awakens her unique form of magic.  

- **EMERGENCE: 68 / REGENERATE: -48**  
  They obtain a special recorder made from **fragments**, capable of storing their songs in another world.  

- **EMERGENCE: 81 / REGENERATE: -27**  
  They complete a song to enhance their magic power against the **Tesseractors**.  

- **EMERGENCE: 89 / REGENERATE: -9**  
  The witchlings defeat a Tesseractor through their own strength for the first time.  

- **EMERGENCE: 105 / REGENERATE: -3**  
  They discover a method to communicate with the real world via an **Altar**.  

- **EMERGENCE: 106 / REGENERATE: -2**  
  For the first time, observer consciousnesses are summoned into Kamitsubaki City (not physically, only mentally).  
  The observers’ **fragments** become the source of power to defy destruction.  

- **EMERGENCE: 107 / REGENERATE: -1**  
  Kafu meets **Laplace** and summons about 25,000 observer consciousnesses.  
  But the progenitor’s power overwhelms them, devouring all but Laplace.  
  The progenitor begins eroding the real world, severing communication.  

- **EMERGENCE: 108 / REGENERATE: 0**  
  With the power of countless observer fragments, Kafu sings the **Song of Purification**, embodying all their wills, and finally repels the progenitor.  
  Kafu forms a **Pact** with **L (Laplace)**, who becomes her **Familier**, gradually gaining humanity.  
  Kamitsubaki City’s population surges, and the Reconstruction Division is reborn.  

  The following summer, the progenitor revives—its core never fully destroyed—and attacks Kamitsubaki City once more.  
  - Kafu is mortally wounded in battle against **Descartes** and sacrifices herself.  
  - Sekai is attacked by **Anemos** and **Agni**; poisoned, She become Haru’s Familier, and both perish together.  
  - Rime and **Hastur** die in mutual destruction.  
  - **L**, seeking revenge, fights Descartes and falls.  
  - **Koko** is trapped within an interdimensional rift.


## REGENERATE

In later cycles, the **Tesseractors** realize that their ultimate goal is not to kill the witchlings physically,  
but to plunge them into **true despair**.

### The Turning Point: Cycle 109
In the **109th cycle**, the world’s rebirth changes drastically:  
- Unlike the previous reconstructions, this cycle **restores the state before collapse**, rewinding the timeline to the year 2008 — before the five were ever born.  
- Kafu and the others are recreated as infants, becoming native residents of Kamitsubaki City with no memory of the real world.  
- Thus, the Kafu, Rime, Haru, and Sekai of the 109th cycle are not the original witchlings, but **new witchlings** carrying the *will* of their predecessors.  
- As Laplace states: “This Kafu is not the Kafu who once was.”

Therefore, Cycles 0–108 are collectively known as **EMERGENCE** (the *Prologue / Original Worldline*).  
From Cycle 109 onward, the story enters **REGENERATE**, branching into multiple worldlines:

1. **The Observers Arrive in Kamitsubaki City**  
   *(ADV game “Kamitsubaki City Under Construction: REGENERATE” storyline)*  
   - In this timeline, the observer replaces L as Kafu’s Familier, while L remains a guiding figure throughout the story.

2. **The Observers Never Arrive in Kamitsubaki City**  
   *(VIRTUAL WITCH STORY)*  
   - **Novel version**: Ends upon finding and awakening the Reconstruction Chief — no battle with the progenitor.  
   - **Anime version**: Depicts the *True Chapter*, including the final confrontation. Since the Chief is already awake in the anime, it can be seen as the novel’s continuation.  

Though each version stands alone, they follow a broadly consistent narrative framework.
